		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<p id= "bio"> I currently attend Tufts University. My exposure to coding was limited before coming to college, but my love of math and solving problems led me to apply to the School of Engineering.<br><br>In my first semester of college, I really enjoyed the creative problem solving using logic in my computer science class. Building each part of a project piece by piece, and then being able to immediately see if the changes I made were functioning properly, appealed to my visual and tactile learning style. I found equal joy in creating games while also applying that same logic and ideas to create a program that determined the statistical probability of what language an unknown document was written in, given several documents with known languages. I am excited by the wide range of applications and versatility that computer science offers.</p>
